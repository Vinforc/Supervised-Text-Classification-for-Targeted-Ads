Imagine you're a media buying company, Chrishare. They have a new client, Theragun.

Theragun knows that consumers who value health and wellness are more likely to consider, and ultimately buy their product. So, they’d like to find health and wellness news around the web to advertise on. Their goal with their media campaign is to identify as many news articles that mention health and wellness as possible, but we will compare model results with a money-saving oriented goal as well.

This is called contextual advertising: finding the URLs that match the context in which you’d like your ad to be show

Our challenge now is to build a deep learning algorithm that predicts the probability that a news story is about health and wellness using k-train.
